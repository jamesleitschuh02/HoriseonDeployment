##About The Project

Horiseon Deployment is a project dedicated to deploying a live website with a clean code. Opening the code you'll find an easy to read html file of the webpage with descriptive notes. As this code has been refactored, changes to the header tags, semantic tags, and overall structure were made to make this code much more user friendly. Much of the CSS code was condensed to simplify the code.

The deployment of the website has proper formatting, a functioning navigation bar, and easy to use website.
